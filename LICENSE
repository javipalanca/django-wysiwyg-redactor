About Imperavi Redactor

Redactor that is located at "redactor/static/redactor/*" directory is not an open-source product but a proprietary commercial copyrighted software.

I, douglasmirandasilva@gmail.com, have a licence
(https://imperavi.com/redactor/license/) that allows me to offer this proprietary
software (Redactor II) as part of my Django package. So you don't have to buy
the Redactor Licence, as long as you're using the Redactor II on django-wysiwyg-redactor.
